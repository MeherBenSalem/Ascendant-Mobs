# Remnants: RPG Mobs

Every monster gets a level, some get a rank, and the rarest come back with traits, titles and a boss bar.
Remnants: RPG Mobs turns the mobs of Minecraft into RPG enemies: the farther, deeper and longer you go, the
stronger they get, and the better they pay. It pairs with
[RPG Attribute System](https://github.com/MeherBenSalem/rpg-attribute-system) (RAS): monsters measure
themselves against your RAS level and ranked kills pay out Valor.

Formerly **RPG Mob Leveling System** (Ascendant Mobs). Mod id: `remnant_mobs`. 3.0 is a full rebuild; 2.x
configs and leveled mobs carry over.

## Features

- **Levels**: the threat of a place grows with distance from spawn, world age, depth and dimension. Ruins such
  as ancient cities and bastions have their own minimums, and with RAS nearby players pull levels toward their
  own.
- **Ranks**: Veteran, Elite, Champion and Remnant mobs hit harder, take more punishment, and drop more
  experience, extra loot and Remnant Shards.
- **16 traits**: Vampiric, Frostbite, Infernal, Venomous, Withering, Berserk, Crushing, Juggernaut, Thornskin,
  Warded, Regenerating, Deflecting, Swift, Blinking, Packleader and Volatile.
- **Remnants**: the rarest rank gets a generated title ("Vorgrim the Hollow"), a boss bar, a horn when it
  appears and a server-wide message when it falls.
- **Nameplates**: rank crest, level coloured by danger relative to you, a health bar in the rank's colour with
  a trailing damage segment, and traits once you get close.
- **Hunter's Moon**: some full moons turn into a Hunter's Moon. Until dawn, mobs spawn stronger, ranks double and shards
  double.
- **Items**: the Hunter's Lens (threat readout, stat sheet of any mob through the scope) and the Brand of
  Challenge (raise a mob's rank for double rewards).
- **RAS integration**: levels follow RAS levels, plate colours compare with yours, and kills and shards grant
  Valor. Everything works without RAS too.
- 10 advancements, `/remnants` commands, commented JSON configs with `/remnants reload`, and a small API.

## Requirements

| Workspace | Minecraft | Loaders | Java |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `1.20.1/` | 1.20.1 | Fabric, Forge | 17 |
| `1.21.1/` | 1.21.1 | Fabric, NeoForge | 21 |
| `26.1.2/` | 26.1.2 | Fabric, NeoForge | 25 |
| `26.2/` | 26.2 | Fabric, NeoForge | 25 |
| `26.3/` | 26.3 | Fabric, NeoForge | 25 |

Fabric needs Fabric API. RPG Attribute System is optional. Install the mod on both the server and the client:
the server does the leveling and the client draws the plates.

## Building

```bash
cd 1.20.1 && ./gradlew build   # Java 17

Jars land in `<workspace>/<loader>/build/libs/remnant_mobs-<loader>-<minecraft>-<version>.jar`.

## Tools

- `python3 tools/assets/build.py <version|all>` regenerates every texture, sound, model, language file, recipe,
  tag and advancement from code into each workspace.
- `python3 tools/qa/run_all.py <version> <loader>` starts a dev server and client and runs the in-game checks
  (`tools/qa/server_smoke.py`, `tools/qa/client_checks.py`).
- `python3 tools/port_setup.py` lays out a new version workspace from the closest existing one.
